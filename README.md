# Clinic Booking System
## ðŸ§­ Overview
This repository implements a simplified **Clinic Booking System** for the Department of Health and Wellness.  
It consists of a **Blazor WebAssembly frontend** and an **ASP.NET Core Web API backend**, with a shared `Contracts` project defining data models.

The purpose of this README is to help **Codex** understand:
- how to build, run, and test the project, and  
- how to automatically fix or iterate on failed builds.

## ðŸ§© Architecture Summary

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `API/` | ASP.NET Core Web API that exposes endpoints for users, clinics, and bookings. |
| `UI/` | Blazor WebAssembly frontend for booking appointments. |
| `Contracts/` | Shared DTOs and models for request/response data. |
| `Tests/` | xUnit-based tests for backend booking logic. |

Key libraries:

- **MudBlazor** for UI
